# School Management System

This code appears to be written in C and implements a school management system. Here's a breakdown of the code:

**1. Program Structure:**
* The program starts by defining structures for `student` and `teacher` which hold information about each individual.
* It then defines several functions:
    * `add_student_record`: Allows adding a new student record to a file.
    * `add_teacher_record`: Allows adding a new teacher record to a file.
    * `viewAllTeacherRecord`: Prints all teacher records stored in a file.
    * `viewAllStudentRecord`: Prints all student records stored in a file.
    * `search_student_by_roll`: Searches for a specific student by roll number.
    * `search_teacher_by_id`: Searches for a specific teacher by ID number.
    * `edit`: Allows editing information of a student record.
    * `edit_teacher_record`: Allows editing information of a teacher record.
    * `printClassRoutine`: Prints the class routine for different grades and streams.
    * `printStarPatternWithTitle`: Prints a decorative header with the provided title.
    * `displayMenu`: Displays the main menu with options for students, teachers, and academics.
    * `main`: The main function that controls the program flow.

**2. Functionality:**
* The program allows adding, viewing, searching, and editing both student and teacher records.
* It also provides functions to print the class routine for different grades and streams.
* The main menu allows users to choose the desired functionality.

**3. Security:**
* The program attempts basic authentication by asking for username and password.
* However, the login credentials are stored in plain text within the program, which is not a secure practice.

**4. Additional Notes:**
* The program uses `FILE` pointers to read and write data to files.
* The code assumes the presence of files named "students.txt" and "teachers.txt" for storing student and teacher records.
* The program uses various formatting techniques to improve user experience.

**Overall, this code demonstrates a well-structured school management system with basic functionalities. However, it is important to address the security concerns regarding password storage before deploying it in a real-world environment.**
